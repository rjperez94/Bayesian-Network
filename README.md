## Fictional Problem
Dr. Rachel Nicholson is a Professor, who lives far away from her university. So, she prefer to work at home and she only comes to her office if she has research meetings with her postgraduate
students, or teaching lectures for undergraduate students, or she has both meetings and teaching: 

- The probability for Rachel to have meetings is 70%
- The probability of Rachel has lectures is 60%
- If Rachel has both meetings and lectures, the probability of Rachel comes to her office is 95%
- If Rachel only has meetings (without lectures), the probability of Rachel comes to her office is 75% (because she can Skype with her students)
- If Rachel only has lectures (without meetings), the probability of Rachel comes to her office is 80% (because she can Skype with her students)
- If Rachel has neither meetings nor lectures, there is a only 6% chance that she comes to the office
- When Rachel is in her office, half the time her light is off (when she is trying to hide from others to get work done quickly)
- When she is not in her office, she leaves her light on only 2% of the time since the cleaners come for cleaning
- When Rachel is in her office, 80% of the time she logged onto the computer
- Because she sometimes work from home, 20% of the time she is not in her office, she is still logged onto the computer
